        STAR-formatted read group information. Suggested setting format is:
        ID:sample_name LB:aliquot_id PL:platform SM:BSID for example ID:7316-242
        LB:750189 PL:ILLUMINA SM:BS_W72364MN. STAR will automatically convert unquoted
        spaces into tabs. If you wish to have a value with whitespace, the VALUE
        must be enclosed in double quotes. Refer to the start documentation for
        complete input details. If not provided, value will be autogenerated based on
        the reads1 file basename.
