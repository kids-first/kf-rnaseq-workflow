        STAR-formatted read group information. Suggested setting format is:
        ID:sample_name LB:aliquot_id PL:platform SM:BSID for example ID:7316-242
        LB:750189 PL:ILLUMINA SM:BS_W72364MN. STAR will automatically convert unquoted
        spaces into tabs. If you wish to have a value with whitespace, the KEY:VALUE
        must be enclosed in double quotes. Refer to the start documentation for
        complete input details. If not provided, value will be autogenerated based on
        the reads1 file basename.
