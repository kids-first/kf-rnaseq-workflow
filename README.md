# Kids First RNA-Seq Workflow

This is the Kids First RNA-Seq pipeline, which includes fusion and expression detection.

## Introduction
This pipeline utilizes cutadapt to trim adapters from the raw reads, if necessary, and passes the reads to STAR for alignment.
The alignment output is used by RSEM for gene expression abundance estimation.
Additionally, Kallisto is used for quantification, but uses pseudoalignments to estimate the gene abundance from the raw data.
Fusion calling is performed using Arriba and STAR-Fusion detection tools on the STAR alignment outputs.
Filtering and prioritization of fusion calls is done by annoFuse.
Metrics for the workflow are generated by RNA-SeQC.

If you would like to run this workflow using the cavatica public app, a basic primer on running public apps can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/d3b/Starting-From-Scratch-Running-Cavatica-af5ebb78c38a4f3190e32e67b4ce12bb).
Alternatively, if you'd like to run it locally using `cwltool`, a basic primer on that can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/d3b/Starting-From-Scratch-Running-CWLtool-b8dbbde2dc7742e4aff290b0a878344d) and combined with app-specific info from the readme below.
This workflow is the current production workflow, equivalent to this [Cavatica public app](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/public/apps#cavatica/apps-publisher/kfdrc-rnaseq-workflow).

## Usage

### Runtime Estimates:
- 8 GB single end FASTQ input: 66 Minutes & $2.00
- 17 GB single end FASTQ input: 58 Minutes & $2.00

### Inputs common:
```yaml
inputs:
  sample_name: string
  r1_adapter: {type: ['null', string]}
  r2_adapter: {type: ['null', string]}
  STAR_outSAMattrRGline: string
  STARgenome: File
  RSEMgenome: File
  reference_fasta: File
  gtf_anno: File
  FusionGenome: File
  runThread: int
  RNAseQC_GTF: File
  kallisto_idx: File
  wf_strand_param: {type: [{type: enum, name: wf_strand_param, symbols: ["default", "rf-stranded", "fr-stranded"]}], doc: "use 'default' for unstranded/auto, 'rf-stranded' if read1 in the fastq read pairs is reverse complement to the transcript, 'fr-stranded' if read1 same sense as transcript"}
  input_type: {type: [{type: enum, name: input_type, symbols: ["BAM", "FASTQ"]}], doc: "Please select one option for input file type, BAM or FASTQ."}
```

### Bam input-specific:
```yaml
inputs:
  reads1: File
```

### PE Fastq input-specific:
```yaml
inputs:
  reads1: File
  reads2: File
```

### SE Fastq input-specific:
```yaml
inputs:
  reads1: File
```

### Run:

1) For fastq or bam input, run `kfdrc-rnaseq-wf` as this can accept both file types.
For PE fastq input, please enter the reads 1 file in `reads1` and the reads 2 file in `reads2`.
For SE fastq input, enter the single ends reads file in `reads1` and leave `reads2` empty as it is optional.
For bam input, please enter the reads file in `reads1` and leave `reads2` empty as it is optional.

2) `r1_adapter` and `r2_adapter` are OPTIONAL.
If the input reads have already been trimmed, leave these as null and cutadapt step will simple pass on the fastq files to STAR.
If they do need trimming, supply the adapters and the cutadapt step will trim, and pass trimmed fastqs along.

3) `wf_strand_param` is a workflow convenience param so that, if you input the following, the equivalent will propagate to the four tools that use that parameter:
    - `default`: 'rsem_std': null, 'kallisto_std': null, 'rnaseqc_std': null, 'arriba_std': null. This means unstranded or auto in the case of arriba.
    - `rf-stranded`: 'rsem_std': 0, 'kallisto_std': 'rf-stranded', 'rnaseqc_std': 'rf', 'arriba_std': 'reverse'.  This means if read1 in the input fastq/bam is reverse complement to the transcript that it maps to.
    - `fr-stranded`: 'rsem_std': 1, 'kallisto_std': 'fr-stranded', 'rnaseqc_std': 'fr', 'arriba_std': 'yes'. This means if read1 in the input fastq/bam is the same sense (maps 5' to 3') to the transcript that it maps to.

4) Suggested `STAR_outSAMattrRGline`, with **TABS SEPARATING THE TAGS**,  format is:

    `ID:sample_name LB:aliquot_id   PL:platform SM:BSID` for example `ID:7316-242   LB:750189 PL:ILLUMINA SM:BS_W72364MN`

# D3b annoFuse Workflow

## Introduction

In this workflow, annoFuse performs standardization of StarFusion and arriba output files to retain information regarding fused genes, breakpoints, reading frame information as well as annotation from FusionAnnotator, output format description [here](https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse/wiki#1-standardize-calls-from-fusion-callers-to-retain-information-regarding-fused-genesbreakpoints-reading-frame-information-as-well-as-annotation-from-fusionannotator). Basic artifact filtering to remove fusions among gene paralogs, conjoined genes and fused genes found in normal samples is also performed by filtering fusions annotated by [FusionAnnotator](https://github.com/d3b-center/FusionAnnotator) with "GTEx_Recurrent|DGD_PARALOGS|Normal|BodyMap|ConjoinG". Each fusion call needs at least one junction reads support to be retained as true call. Additionally, if a fusion call has large number of spanning fragment reads compared to junction reads (spanning fragment minus junction read greater than ten), we remove these calls as potential false positives. An expression based filter is also applied, requiring a min FPKM value of 1 for the fusion genes in question.

Please refer to [annoFuse](https://github.com/d3b-center/annoFuse) R package for additional applications like putative oncogene annotations.

Current version is 0.90.0, docker pull tag: `kfdrc/annofuse:0.90.0`
