# Kids First RNA-Seq Workflow V4

This is the Kids First RNA-Seq pipeline, which calculates gene and transcript isoform expression, detects fusions ans splice junctions.
We are transitioning to to this current version which upgrades several software components.
Our legacy workflow is still available as [v3.0.1](https://github.com/kids-first/kf-rnaseq-workflow/tree/v3.0.1), and on Cavatica, [revision 8](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/public/apps/cavatica/apps-publisher/kfdrc-rnaseq-workflow/8)

## Introduction
This pipeline has an optional cutadapt to trim adapters from the raw reads, alignment-to-fastq conversion if necessary, and passes the reads to STAR for alignment.
The alignment output is used by RSEM for gene expression abundance estimation and rMATS for differential alternative splicing events detection.
Additionally, Kallisto is used for quantification, but uses pseudoalignments to estimate the gene abundance from the raw data.
Fusion calling is performed using Arriba and STAR-Fusion detection tools on the STAR alignment outputs.
Filtering and prioritization of fusion calls is done by annoFuse.
Metrics for the workflow are generated by RNA-SeQC.
Junction files for the workflow are generated by rMATS.

If you would like to run this workflow using the cavatica public app, a basic primer on running public apps can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/d3b/Starting-From-Scratch-Running-Cavatica-af5ebb78c38a4f3190e32e67b4ce12bb).
Alternatively, if you would like to run it locally using `cwltool`, a basic primer on that can be found [here](https://www.notion.so/d3b/Starting-From-Scratch-Running-CWLtool-b8dbbde2dc7742e4aff290b0a878344d) and combined with app-specific info from the readme below.
This workflow is the current production workflow, equivalent to this [Cavatica public app](https://cavatica.sbgenomics.com/public/apps#cavatica/apps-publisher/kfdrc-rnaseq-workflow).

## Usage

### Runtime Estimates:
Based on a test set of five input bams, Cavatica compute and storage estimates:
 - Typical 2 hour run time, 10 hours is a higher end possibility
 - Cost:
   - Pure spot instances with no terminations: $2.37 mean
   - Pure on-demand: $5.19 mean
   - Warning: If spot instance kill rate is high, especially for `c5.9xlarge` instance type, the cost could end up greater than on-demand
 - Storage:
   - Total output size 6GB mean
   - Storage estimate ~ $0.14 per month

### Run:

1) Reads inputs:

- For PE fastq input, please enter the reads 1 file in `reads1` and the reads 2 file in `reads2`.
- For SE fastq input, enter the single ends reads file in `reads1` and leave `reads2` empty as it is optional.
- For alignment input (SAM/BAM/CRAM), please enter the reads file in `reads1` and leave `reads2` empty as it is optional.

2) `r1_adapter` and `r2_adapter` are OPTIONAL:

- If the input reads have already been trimmed, leave these as null and cutadapt step will simple pass on the fastq files to STAR.
- If they do need trimming, supply the adapters and the cutadapt step will trim, and pass trimmed fastqs along.
- `min_len` if adapter is trimmed, currently set to min `20` bp. Change this as you see fit
- `quality_base` set to phred scale `33` by default if trimming. There was a weird time when `64` was used - change if different
- `quality_cutoff` if adapter is trimmed and you want to set a min bp quality. A single value will apply to both paired ends, 2 values will allow you to assign a different one to each (unusual)

3) `wf_strand_param` is now *optional* as the workflow will try to determine strandedness for you. Note: if the workflow fails to detect a strandedness, it will fail. If you'd like to override autodetect, it is a workflow convenience param so that, if you input the following, the equivalent will propagate to the four tools that use that parameter:

- `default`: 'rsem_std': null, 'kallisto_std': null, 'rnaseqc_std': null, 'arriba_std': null. This means unstranded or auto in the case of arriba.
- `rf-stranded`: 'rsem_std': 0, 'kallisto_std': 'rf-stranded', 'rnaseqc_std': 'rf', 'arriba_std': 'reverse'.  This means if read1 in the input fastq/bam is reverse complement to the transcript that it maps to.
- `fr-stranded`: 'rsem_std': 1, 'kallisto_std': 'fr-stranded', 'rnaseqc_std': 'fr', 'arriba_std': 'yes'. This means if read1 in the input fastq/bam is the same sense (maps 5' to 3') to the transcript that it maps to.

4) Suggested STAR `outSAMattrRGline` format is `ID:sample_name LB:aliquot_id   PL:platform SM:BSID`:

For example, `ID:7316-242   LB:750189 PL:ILLUMINA SM:BS_W72364MN`

These `KEY:VALUE` fields can be separated by either a whitespace or tab
character. Any unquoted whitespace will be automatically converted to a tab
value by STAR. If you wish to include whitespaces in your `VALUE`, you must put
double quotes around the `KEY:VALUE`. For example if you wanted a `DS` key with a
`I love read groups` value, the entry would look like: `ID:xxx "DS:I love read
groups"`. See the STAR documentation on `outSAMattrRGline` for complete details.

5) Suggested REFERENCE inputs are:

- `reference_fasta`: [GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_39/GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa.gz), will need to unzip
- `gtf_anno`: [gencode.v39.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf](https://ftp.ebi.ac.uk/pub/databases/gencode/Gencode_human/release_39/gencode.v39.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf.gz), will need to unzip
- `FusionGenome`: GRCh38_v39_CTAT_lib_Mar242022.CUSTOM.tar.gz. A custom library built using instructions from (https://github.com/STAR-Fusion/STAR-Fusion/wiki/installing-star-fusion#preparing-the-genome-resource-lib), using GENCODE 39 reference.
- `RNAseQC_GTF`: gencode.v39.primary_assembly.rnaseqc.stranded.gtf OR gencode.v39.primary_assembly.rnaseqc.unstranded.gtf, built using `gtf_anno` and following build instructions [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/rnaseqc#usage) and [here](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/tree/master/gene_model)
- `RSEMgenome`: RSEM_GENCODE39.tar.gz, built using the `reference_fasta` and `gtf_anno`, following `GENCODE` instructions from [here](https://deweylab.github.io/RSEM/README.html), then creating a tar ball of the results.
- `STARgenome`: STAR_2.7.10a_GENCODE39.tar.gz, created using the star_2.7.10a_genome_generate.cwl tool, using the `reference_fasta`, `gtf_anno`, and setting `sjdbOverhang` to 100
- `kallisto_idx`: RSEM_GENCODE39.transcripts.kallisto.idx, built from RSEM GENCODE 39 transcript fasts, in `RSEMgenome` tar ball, following instructions from [here](https://pachterlab.github.io/kallisto/manual)

6) rMATS requires the length of the reads in the sample. This workflow will attempt to estimate the read length based on a polling of reads. If the user wishes to override this value they can set `read_length_median` to their desired read length. Additionally, there is a `rmats_variable_read_length` boolean that users can set if their reads are not uniform in length. This workflow will poll the reads and set that value to true if it observes multiple read lengths. Like read length, user-provided input will override this guess.

7) While `output_basename`, `sample_name`, and `outSAMattrRGline` are optional, it is strongly recommended that the user provide these values for data quality purposes. If the user does not provide these values, the basename of the reads1 file will be substituted in their place.

- `output_basename` and `sample_name` values will become `reads1.basename.split('.')[0]`
- `outSAMattrRGline` value will become `ID:reads1.basename.split('.')[0]_1 LB:reads1.basename.split('.')[0] SM:reads1.basename.split('.')[0] PL:Illumina`
- Additionally, if no `outSAMattrRGline` input is provided a disclaimer will be added to the `@RG` header line that reads: `DS:Values for this read group were auto-generated and may not reflect the true read group information.`

## Reference build notes:
 - STAR-Fusion reference built with command `/usr/local/STAR-Fusion/ctat-genome-lib-builder/prep_genome_lib.pl --gtf gencode.v39.primary_assembly.annotation.gtf --annot_filter_rule ../AnnotFilterRule.pm --CPU 36 --fusion_annot_lib ../fusion_lib.Mar2021.dat.gz --genome_fa ../GRCh38.primary_assembly.genome.fa --output_dir GRCh38_v39_CTAT_lib_Mar242022.CUSTOM --human_gencode_filter --pfam_db current --dfam_db human 2> build.errs > build.out &`
 - fusion_annotator_ref built by placing GRCh38_v39_CTAT_lib_Mar242022.CUSTOM/fusion_annot_lib.idx and GRCh38_v39_CTAT_lib_Mar242022.CUSTOM/blast_pairs.idx into its own tar ball
 - kallisto index built using RSEM `RSEM_GENCODE39.transcripts.fa` file as transcriptome fasta, using command: `kallisto index -i RSEM_GENCODE39.transcripts.kallisto.idx RSEM_GENCODE39.transcripts.fa`
 - RNA-SEQc reference built using [collapse gtf script](https://github.com/broadinstitute/gtex-pipeline/blob/master/gene_model/collapse_annotation.py)
   - Two references needed if data are stranded vs. unstranded
   - Flag `--collapse_only` used for stranded
